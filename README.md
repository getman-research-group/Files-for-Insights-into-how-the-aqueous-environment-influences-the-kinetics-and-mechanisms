This repository contains geometry files in the VASP POSCAR format for reaction intermediate and transition state structures.
<ul>
  <li>Reaction intermediates are labeled as [chemical formula].POSCAR</li>
  <li>Transition states are labeled as r[reaction number]c[configuration number].POSCAR</li>
  <li>Multiple structures for H<sub>2</sub>O and H<sub>5</sub>O<sub>2</sub> are included. These structures were obtained from an AIMD trajectory, and include <q>parallel</q> and <q>perpendicular</q> orientations</li>
</ul>
